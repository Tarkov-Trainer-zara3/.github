## 🎯 What is a Tarkov Trainer?

A **Tarkov trainer** is an external software tool that hooks into your game and lets you activate cheats on the fly. Unlike rage hacks or aimbots, trainers are more about *utility, survivability, and QoL boosts*. Perfect for PvE-style play, offline training, or testing gear without losing progress.

Trainers are ideal for players who want advantages but don’t need to go full rage mode.
